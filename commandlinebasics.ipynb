    "#### Examining Files \n",
    "\n",
    "- To examine content (especially larger content) in a file you can use `cat` or `less`. `less` is great because it displays a file one screenful at a time. However, `cat` can be a more straightforward option.\n",

    "    ~~~bash\n",
    "        $ less filename.txt\n",
    "    ~~~\n",
    "    \n",

    "    ~~~\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If you want to peek at the first or last few lines of a file, use `head` or `tail`. `head` and `tail` will print 10 lines by default. Use `-n` with a number to print a specific number of lines (e.g., `head -n3 filename.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To view the number of lines, words and characters in the file use `wc filename.txt`\n",
    "       \n",
    "    - Use `-l`, `-w`, or `-c` options to print only the number of lines, words, or characters. For example `wc -l filename.txt`\n",
    "       \n",
    "- Wildcards or meta characters can also be used to examine or search for content  \n",
    "    - `*` represents **any** number of unknown characters. For example we can search and print a list of files that contain a specific string e.g., we can search for a list of files that end in .txt using the `*` wildcard: (This might not yield many results but it's meant to illustrate the idea)\n",

    "- To execute several processes at the same time, use a pipe `|`. With a pipe, `grep` can also recieve input from the first command's output to search for specific directories. \n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "    ~~~bash\n",
    "        $ find . -type d -name \"*ABC*\" | grep 123\n",
    "    ~~~\n",
    "    \n",
    "The example above is searching for (or finding) (`find`) a directory or directories (`-type d`) that have the pattern ABC (`\"*ABC*\"`) somewhere in the name (`-name`) within the current working direcotry (`.`). And the output from `find` is being received as input from `grep` and then searching to match the pattern (`123`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default `grep` is case sensitive. So to search for lowercase letters use the option `-i` which will perform case insensitive matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also have `grep` search for inverted matches, i.e., that donâ€™t match a given pattern, with the `-v` option.\n"
