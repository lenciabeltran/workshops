    "- Navigating down files\n",
    "   2. `cd..` (move back a directory)\n",
    "        - To view files in higher level directories can also do `ls ../` which will go back 2 levels and show your root/home directory (e.g., lbeltran) or go back 1 level `ls ../../` to see files in your Desktop directory  \n",

    "    - current directory: `/home/user/documents/`\n",
    "    - relative path: `projects/reports.txt` (points to `home/user/documents/projects/report.txt`) \n",

    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Easier to use when referencing files within the same project or nearby directories\n",
    "    2. Allows portability across systems where the absolute root path may differ\n",

    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "2. An **abosolute path** specifies the complete location of a file or directory starting from the root of the file system. \n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - absolute path: `/home/user/documents/projects/report.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Unambiguous, as it always points to the exact same location, regardless of the current working directory\n",
    "    2. Usfeul in scripts or configurations that require fixed references. \n",
