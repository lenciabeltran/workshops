    "- `pwd` AKA print working directory\n",
    "- `ls` AKA print a list of items in your working directory (including different options); \n",
    "   1. `ls -a` (show all) \n",

    "- Navigating up files\n",
    "   1. `cd`\n",
    "- Navigating down files\n",
    "   2. `cd..` (move back a directory)\n",
    "        - To view files in higher level directories can also do `ls ./` which will go back 1 level or go back 2 levels `ls ./../` to see files in your root/home directory (e.g., lbeltran) \n",

    "#### Relative and absolute paths\n",
    "1. A **relative path** specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory (i.e., the directory you are currently in).\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - current directory: `/home/user/documents/`\n",
    "    - relative path: `projects/reports.txt` (points to `home/user/documents/projects/report.txt`) \n",
    "           \n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Easier to use when referencing files within the same project or nearby directories\n",
    "    2. Allows portability across systems where the absolute root path may differ\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Key points: often starts with `./` (current directory) or `../` (parent directory)\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "2. An **abosolute path** specifies the complete location of a file or directory starting from the root of the file system. \n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - absolute path: `/home/user/documents/projects/report.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Unambiguous, as it always points to the exact same location, regardless of the current working directory\n",
    "    2. Usfeul in scripts or configurations that require fixed references. \n",

    "- Key points: always starts with `/` (root directory on Unix-like systems) or a drive letter (e.g., `C:\\` on Windows).\n"
